# cyberpunk

Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting that tends to focus
on a "combination of lowlife and high tech", featuring futuristic technological and scientific achievements,
such as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with societal collapse or decay.
Much of cyberpunk is rooted in the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers like Philip K. Dick,
Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny, John Brunner, J. G. Ballard, Philip Jos√© Farmer and Harlan Ellison examined the impact of drug culture, 
technology, and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction.
