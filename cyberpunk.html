    <h2>CHAPTER 5: API Patterns</h2>

    <p class="pText">APIs should be designed for longevity. Any change to an API carries the risk of breaking
      the client’s application code. Frequent changes to an API frustrate the developers and
      the consumers using it. Building APIs from robust and proven patterns fosters a happy
      developer community and saves the company a lot of money. This chapter looks at
      some of the API design principles and patterns that have stood the test of time and make
      developers happy.</p>

    <h3>Best Practices for Building a Pragmatic RESTful API</h3>
    <p class="pText">APIs are the face of your enterprise. They provide users with access to enterprise data,
      services, and assets. Hence, while security should be ingrained in it, the API interface
      should be simple and elegant to attract developers. It should be intuitive and developerfriendly
      to make adoption easy and pleasant.</p>
    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li>Design APIs with RESTful URLs. Design an API based on the
        logical grouping of identified resources. The API URL should
        point to either a collection of resources/subresources or an
        individual entity within the collection.</li>
      <li>Use HTTP verbs for CRUD action on resources. Use the HTTP
        verbs to perform CRUD action on the resources. Use POST
        to create a new resource, GET to read, PUT to update, and
        DELETE to delete a resource. Additionally, you may consider
        providing support for the PATCH verb in the API resource for
        partial updates.</li>
      <li>Use operation in the URL when HTTP verb cannot map to
        the action. Often, an action on a resource cannot be directly
        mapped to an HTTP verb. For example, actions such as register,
        activate, and so forth, cannot be directly mapped to an HTTP
        verb.</li>
      <li>Use SSL/TLS for all communications with REST APIs. RESTful
        APIs expose enterprise data and assets. These can be accessed
        from within the company or from outside the firewall over the
        Internet from anywhere. This poses a security threat to the
        data transferred over the network.</li>
      <li>Do not redirect from non-SSL API endpoints to SSL endpoints.
        This is a practice to always avoid when designing REST APIs.
        Malicious clients may gain access to actual secured and encrypted
        API resources through such redirections.</li>
      <li>API versions. Versioning iterates and improves APIs by
        providing a smooth transition path. It supports multiple versions
        of the APIs simultaneously and provides time for clients to
        upgrade to new version and provider to retire the old version.</li>
      <li>Design the API interface to support filtering on the result
        set. The response to a GET request for an API resource may
        sometimes be quite large. Displaying this large response in
        the consumer app may be quite challenging considering the
        limited form factor and processing power on the device.</li>
      <li>Design the API to support pagination. Pagination is yet another
        feature that is useful in handling large responses from an API.
        Even the filtered response from the back-end service for an API
        may contain hundreds of records. In such a scenario, it makes
        sense to display only ten of them on a page in the consumer app
        and provide a link to the next page with the next set of records.</li>
      <li>Return resource representation in response to creating and
        updating. The response for POST, PUT, and PATCH operations
        results in creating and/or updating a resource. The API response
        payload for these methods should include metainformation
        such as 'created_at' or 'updated_at' along with the created
        or updated representation of the resource.</li>
      <li>Use HTTP headers to specify the media type for the message
        payload. When sending a request or a response, include the
        'Content-Type' header to specify the content type for the
        message payload. This helps the message recipient to easily
        identify the parser to be used for processing the message.</li>
      <li>Use HTTP headers to support caching. HTTP provides builtin
        features to support caching. HTTP provides a number of
        useful headers to efficiently communicate caching information.
        The 'ETag' header contains a hashed value of the resource
        information.</li>
      <li>Secure APIs using authentication information in HTTP
        header. APIs exposing data and assets should always be secured.
        Authentication credentials should be included in the HTTP
        Authorization header. Since REST services are stateless, cookies
        should not be used. Session information if any should be passed in
        custom HTTP headers.</li>
      <li>Handle Errors using HTTP Status code and appropriate error
        messages. In case of errors, APIs should respond with useful
        error messages in a consumable format. Appropriate HTTP
        error response codes in 4XX or 5XX series should be used.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>API Management Patterns</h3>
    <p class="pText">Enterprise services provide access to assets and legacy systems. SOAP and REST APIs
      are the two most common implementation technologies used for building services. An
      API management platform is used to transform and manage these services to make them
      more flexible, scalable, and secure. Various implementation patterns have emerged to
      help address different challenges.</p>
    <h3>API Facade Pattern</h3>
    <p class="pText">The API facade pattern helps the API team create developer-friendly API designs and
      connect to complex enterprise legacy record systems.Back-end and internal system of records are often quite
      complex. They could be
      built using variety of technologies and sometimes even legacy ones. These are difficult to
      change due to the strong dependencies built over time and the complexity involved.Therefore flexibility and
      agility needed for the digital business becomes
      difficult to achieve. Creating an API for a single system of record may still be possible, but
      the real problem is in creating an API for a group of complementary systems that needs
      to be used to make an API really valuable to the developer. In this situation, API facade
      patterns come in handy for creating a simple API interface for a set of complex backend
      systems that are hard to change for digital transformation.</p>
    <h3>API Composition</h3>
    <p class="pText">Take for example that an app needs to interact with three different services for one of its
      transactions (see Figure 5-2). In this case, the client app has to be built so that it makes
      multiple calls directly to services, negotiates any security challenges, and does data
      format changes as required. With this approach, the client app is responsible for all the
      orchestration, data transformation and normalization, security, service connectivity, and
      retry mechanisms. This is indeed an overhead on the client app, considering the limited
      processing power available on the mobile devices. It is helpful for the developer building
      the app, if all these tasks can be off-loaded somewhere.Implementing the API composition pattern in the API facade
      layer can be a solution
      to this problem. With API composition, the developers can concentrate on the UI and
      business functionality. It makes the communication less chatty with reduced network
      calls between the app and the back-end services.Using an API gateway to implement the API facade pattern for
      composition is a
      common practice. An API gateway is a server that acts as a single point of entry into
      the system. It encapsulates the internal system architecture and provides an API that is
      customized for the client.</p>
    <h3>Session Management</h3>
    <p class="pText">API services should be designed to be stateless. But sometimes state management
      becomes necessary for designing an app with better user experience. Shopping cart, hotel
      booking are some examples where session management is necessary. Sessions maintain
      the client context on the server. In the API world, managing session information in the
      client apps running on devices is difficult. Devices are already constrained for memory
      and processing capacity. Hence, session management is an additional overhead, which
      can slowdown the overall performance.</p>
    <h3>Two-Phase Transaction Management</h3>
    <p class="pText">In a two-phase transaction, the transaction coordinator prepares the participating
      resources for a transaction in the first step. If the first step is successful, the commit is
      issued to the participating resources in the second step.Exposing each transaction phase as an API and expecting
      the client app to coordinate
      the transaction, and roll over in case of failure, is an over kill. Managing all transaction
      from the client app is going to result in a chatty conversation. The complex processing
      logic in the app for transaction coordination and management definitely yields a poor app
      performance. The solution is to handle the conversation from an API facade. The logic to
      prepare, commit, and roll back two-phase transaction management is implemented in the
      facade.booking service can expose only one endpoint to access it (/hotelbooking). This endpoint
      may in turn invoke two separate endpoints: one to reserve the hotel (/reserve) in the
      prepare phase and the second to make the payment (/payment) to confirm the
      reservation in the commit phase. This way the client need not directly access both
      /reserve and /payment services and nor does it have to manage the two-phase
      transaction.</p>
    <h3>Synchronous to Asynchronous Mediation</h3>
    <p class="pText">In many scenarios, the application client needs to access a back-end service that is long
      running and may not provide an immediate response. The mobile app cannot wait for
      the entire duration till the response is received. A typical example is sending a message.
      Suppose that you are building a mobile app that sends an SMS to a given number. After
      the message is sent, the mobile network takes its own time to deliver the message to the
      recipient depending on various factors. The message delivery status may be available
      almost immediately or after sometime depending on the network traffic and other factors.
      The back-end service is asynchronous. However, the mobile app expects a synchronous
      response. So how do you implement this? An API facade can provide a solution to this.
      Implementing a callback pattern on the API facade is the first step to this solution.</p>
    <h3>Routing</h3>
    <p class="pText">In a complex service composition scenario, the routing rules may not be fixed. The back
      end to which the request should be routed may have to be dynamically determined based
      on parameters in the incoming request. This is also known as content-based routing. The
      parameters for routing may be present in the request header or the message payload. In
      the API facade, these parameters are extracted and inspected to determine the back-end
      endpoint to which the request should be routed.</p>

    <h3>API Throttling</h3>
    <p class="pText">When an enterprise opens their API to the external world, it is expected to see an increase
      in the API traffic. Developers use these APIs to build new innovative apps. As more apps
      are built and adopted by users, the overall traffic is bound to increase. Also since the
      APIs are now open to the public, there may be some unexpected and unwanted load
      coming from some malicious apps, which may try to bring down the system. The current
      back-end systems may not have been designed to scale up and withstand this increased
      load. To maintain the performance and overall stability, it is important to maintain the
      overall traffic within the capacity limits of the back-end system by throttling the API.</p>

    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li>Spike Arrest: With Spike Arrest, you can detect sudden
        unexpected changes to the traffic pattern. Applying a Spike
        Arrest policy smooths out the traffic by uniformly distributing the
        traffic across each smaller interval. For example, if the set spike
        arrest limit is 60 per minute, then only one request is allowed
        every second. If in any second there is more than one request,
        they would all be throttled. Similarly, if the spike arrest is 200
        per second, then only one request is allowed per 5 milliseconds.
        If there is more than one request in any 5-millisecond interval,
        subsequent requests is throttles. The value of the spike arrest
        should be calculated based on the capacity of the back-end
        services. The limits should be configured for shorter intervals
        such as sec or minutes. This feature protects the back-end
        services against sudden traffic burst coming from some malicious
        users or apps.</li>
      <li>Rate Limit or Quota: With a Rate Limiting approach (also
        sometime referred to as Quota), the requests are throttled based
        on the originating app or user, region of origination, time of the
        day and various other factors over a period of time. The request
        within the specified limit is routed successfully to the target
        system. Those beyond the limit are rejected.</li>
      <li>Concurrent back-end connections: Sometimes legacy backend
        systems might have the strict restrictions on the number
        of connections that can be made. By implementing throttling
        using concurrent connections, you can limit the number of
        simultaneous connections that can be made from the API to
        the back-end services at any given point of time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Caching</h3>
    <p class="pText">Caching pattern can be used within an API gateway to cache backend responses or
      any information required for processing the request. When a client makes the same
      request, the cached response is returned to the client instead of forwarding the request
      to the back-end. This improves the overall API performance and improves the stability
      of the system by reducing the load on the back-end servers.</p>
    <h3>Logging and Monitoring</h3>
    <p class="pText">Logging is one of the best ways to identify and track problems. It is no different in the
      world of APIs. In fact, given the distributed nature of APIs, the importance of logging and
      monitoring increases significantly. To help identify problems during the processing of API
      requests, critical information should be logged. The information for logging should be
      collected at all stages of message processing and logged at the end of message processing
      or in the event of an error. Logging can be done to syslog or to a local file system. The
      ability to log to a local file system is generally available on a private cloud setup of API
      management platforms.The information logged should provide sufficient data to detect, find, and analyze
      the issue. Since APIs are used for distributed communication, log information should
      help locate the source of the issue. It should also provide information about the date/time
      of the issue, description of the issue with error codes and messages and a correlation ID
      to relate it to events in other applications of the system.</p>

      class="imagen-articulo">
    <h3>API Analytics</h3>
    <p class="pText">Implementing APIs for digital transformation is not enough. You need visibility into
      your API program to measure the success and make strategic investments. API analytics
      provide insight into the API program through information about the API traffic pattern
      and performance metrics. An API analytics dashboard can tell you which APIs are used
      most frequently and how traffic varies over time. You can also get behavioral information
      about the target services in terms of response time, errors rates, size of the payload,
      and so forth. Information about the developer adoption of an API and the geographic
      distribution of API traffic can also be gathered from API analytics. Additionally, you
      can collect custom data from the message payloads and derive useful analytics data for
      making informed business decisions. Analytics data is normally stored in databases and
      later processed, aggregated, and analyzed. Hence, like the logging information, analytics
      data should also be collected at different points in the message flow and processed
      asynchronously to move it to the back-end database for dashboard reporting.</p>
    <h3>API Security Patterns</h3>
    <p class="pText">When APIs provide access to enterprise data and assets to a wide audience, they are
      also opening a larger variety of threats and security challenges for the company. The
      number of malicious assault and denial-of-service (DOS) attacks are increasing as APIs
      make back-end systems more accessible. Since APIs can be accessed programmatically,
      the vulnerability is even greater. Hence, over time, new security patterns have emerged
      to secure the access to APIs and protect back-end systems against various attacks. The
      challenge is in providing an easy access to legitimate and authorized users while making
      it difficult for unauthorized users to access APIs.</p>


    <h3>Common Forms of Attack</h3>
    <p class="pText">Hackers can attack to get access to the system, steal valuable information, or even bring
      down the system that impacts your business. The following are the most common forms
      of attack on APIs.</p>
    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li>DoS attacks: Malicious users flood your system with high-volume
        API traffic that the back-end systems cannot handle, bringing it to
        a halt.</li>
      <li>Scripting attacks: In this kind of attack, attackers inject malicious
        code into the system to get access and possibly tamper back-end
        data and assets. The malicious code can be an SQL statement,
        XPath or XQuery statement, or some script that tries to exploit
        design flows in the system to get access to back-end data.</li>
      <li>Eavesdropping: In this kind of attack, the hacker gets access to an
        API request or response while the data is in transit over a nonsecure
        API communication channel. He can then manipulate the
        message and send it to the ultimate recipient.</li>
      <li>Session attack: In this kind of attack, the hackers gain access to
        the session ID used by a user or app. This information is then
        used for personification and access to the user’s account and
        resources. In this common form of attack, an app makes an API
        call and passes the credentials or session information in the
        header, that can provide access to the underlying assets. The risk
        is worse in scenarios that use a multiparty authentication scheme,
        such as OAuth, to grant permissions to a third party to access to
        access their private data.</li>
      <li>Cross-site scripting (XSS): This is a special form of
        scripting attack that takes advantage of known vulnerabilities
        in a web site or web application. An attacker injects a malicious
        link or code that is executed on the victim’s web browser. This
        form of attack bypasses the same-origin policy that requires
        everything on a web page to come from the same source. When a
        same-origin policy is not enforced, the attacker can inject a script
        or modify the web page to achieve their purpose. An XSS attack
        delivers tainted content to the API from a trusted source that has
        permissions to the system. Hence, the API must protect itself by
        validating the 'Origin' header in the request payload to check
        for the origin before allowing access to back-end resources.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>API Risk Mitigation Best Practices</h3>
    <p class="pText">There are different approaches and patterns that have emerged to protect APIs from
      various forms of security threats and provide comprehensive security. The approaches
      for securing APIs should control access to APIs as well as monitor and limit API usage.
      Controlling access to an API should authenticate and authorize users or apps making
      API calls. It should also scan incoming messages for well-formedness and any potential
      threats in it. A monitoring approach should detect any sudden changes in the API traffic
      pattern and block the user from making calls.</p>


    <h3>Authentication and Authorization</h3>
    <p class="pText">Every app is associated with a unique API key. Hence, API key validation on
      an API management layer can help identify the app and thus control access to the APIs.
      Once an app has been identified and validated, the user using the app should be verified
      to validate the end user permissions to access an API resource.API keys identify the app. It is the responsibility
      of the app to store them securely
      and protect them from misuse. The app should encrypt the key and store it in a secure
      vault to prevent any misuse. HMAC-based encryption can be used for encrypting API
      keys. Also keys should be transmitted in encrypted form over the network using SSL for
      any authentication between the app and the API gateway.OAuth should be used as a mechanism to provide
      authorization to a third-party
      application for access to an end user resource on behalf of them. OAuth helps with
      granting authorization without the need to share user credentials. OAuth 2.0 uses SSL for
      all of its communications. Hence, all user and app information in the OAuth dance with
      the OAuth provider is secured in transit.</p>


    <h3>Protect Against Attacks</h3>
    <p class="pText">Since APIs expose a lot of valuable business data, they are prone to different kinds of
      attacks. API management platforms come with in-built features to detect and eliminate
      such attacks. These platforms provide configurable policies or assertions, which when
      activated or attached in the request pipeline, can detect attacks using malicious contents
      or malformed XML or JSON. Some API platforms can also detect virus signatures. Schema
      validation policies or threat detection policies attached in the request-processing pipeline
      can mitigate the risk of SQL injections, malicious code injection, and business logic or
      parameter attacks. CORS header validation protects against XSS attacks. IP whitelisting is
      another approach to reduce risk from untrusted sources.Preventing APIs against denial-of-service attacks is
      another important security
      consideration. Most API management platforms provide protection against DoS attacks
      using Spike Arrest and Quota policies. The Spike Arrest policy identifies unexpected surge
      in the API traffics and reject all requests exceeding the configured limit.Alerts should be sent if APIs are
      getting overloaded or any
      suspicious pattern of API calls is detected. Using rate limits and quota policies alongs
      with a licensing model that establishes a contractual obligation between the API provider
      and the consumer app and enforces payments for violation of contracts, can minimize
      the risk of DoS attacks.</p>


    <h3>Encrypt Message Exchanges</h3>
    <p class="pText">Often, message payloads sent in API calls contain sensitive information that can be the
      target for man-in-the-middle attacks. An API management platform sits in between the
      client app and the API service provider as an API gateway. All communication between
      the client app and the API service provider through the intermediate API gateway should
      be secured using SSL/TLS encryption by default. A two-way SSL
      between the client app and the API gateway also helps with client authentication. SSL
      should also be enforced for all communications between the API gateway and the
      back-end service. A pervasive security approach for encrypting data using SSL prevents
      against man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>


    <h3>Monitor, Audit, and Log API Traffic</h3>
    <p class="pText">The API management solution should monitor, log and analyze API traffic. It understands
      API usage patterns. An API provider is interested in knowing which is their most popular
      API operation, who is the most popular user of the API, what is the rate of growth of API
      consumers, what is the traffic pattern over a period of time. An insight into all of this
      information helps with planning the API extensions to strengthen API security.Logging and Auditing is also one of
      the major regulatory compliance
      requirement. Various national and industry-specific laws require minimum logging.
      Regulatory compliance requirements in financial industry mandate that you log certain
      API traffic information and make it available as part of the audit and compliance process.</p>


    <h3>Build API Security into the SDLC Process</h3>
    <p class="pText">API security is not possible without a comprehensive set of security policies and
      processes ingrained within the development life cycle of API development. API
      architects should plan to address security for APIs at the start of the API program. They
      should provide guidelines for authentication and authorization to make APIs secure.
      Policies to protect APIs against various forms for attacks and vulnerabilities should
      be defined as part of the security architecture and design. These security policies
      should be implemented and thoroughly tested during the development and testing
      phases. Penetration testing of APIs should be a mandatory step in the testing phase.
      Post deployment, APIs should be continuously monitored for any potential threats and
      performance issues that could potentially indicate any security incident.</p>


    <h3>Use a PCI-Compliant Infrastructure</h3>
    <p class="pText">PCI compliance specifications define a set of guidelines for handling credit card and
      other sensitive information during a transaction or at rest. The consortium of industries
      began in 2006 and includes payment card processing companies like Visa, Mastercard,
      JCB, and Discover. The PCI-DSS compliance requirements apply to all organizations
      that store, process, or transmit credit card or payment information. The intent of this
      specification is to protect card holder data and give confidence to the consumers that
      their sensitive information would not be misused. The following are the some of the
      important guidelines for PCI compliance.</p>
    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li>Build and maintain a secure firewall. Do not use any default
        passwords.</li>

      <li>Protect stored data and encrypt sensitive data in transit.</li>
      <li>All application and systems should be secured and protected
        against unauthorized access using strong access control
        measures.</li>
      <li>Anti-virus and vulnerability management programs should be
        kept updated.</li>
      <li>Monitor network access and test systems regularly.</li>
      <li>Maintain an information security policy.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>API Deployment Patterns</h3>
    <p class="pText">APIs need to be deployed on a platform that is scalable and flexible. The platform should
      simplify API development and deployment. It should also enable the business to manage
      the entire API ecosystem. The platform should drive the customer reach of the APIs and
      support business growth. To meet all of these demands, most API platforms provide two
      deployment models: cloud and on-premise. The decision to choose the right deployment
      model would depend on the business needs. Let’s look at the characteristics of each
      deployment model.</p>
    <h3>Cloud Deployment</h3>
    <p class="pText">The cloud deployment of API gateways is hosted and managed by API platform providers
      on a public cloud, such as AWS or Azure. For example, the Apigee cloud instance is
      hosted on AWS. Cloud deployment provides customers with seamless product upgrades
      and improves the pace of innovation.</p>
    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li>Higher reliability and availability: Cloud platforms provide
        clustered environments that are distributed across multiple data
        centers and regions. This mitigates the risk of data center and
        network outages, and increases the reliability and availability of
        the platform. The API platform vendor handles traffic fluctuations
        and makes capacity adjustments to meet the guaranteed SLA.</li>
      <li>Faster time to market: The cloud instances of the API platforms
        can be spun off almost immediately by the API vendors. This
        saves time and hassle of hardware procurement, setup, and
        configuration. The cloud instances are up and running very
        quickly thus reducing the overall time to market for the API
        program.</li>
      <li>Reduced capital and operational expenditure: Cloud
        deployments are generally available in a subscription model. You
        pay by usage like number of API calls. This avoids upfront capital
        expenditures and reduces ongoing in-house operational costs.</li>
      <li>Reduced management overhead: Letting the API vendor focus
        on the data center infrastructure helps enterprises focus on
        building their API services. The API platform provider takes
        care of management over heads of running and managing
        the data center. They address all availability and performance
        management of the underlying infrastructure. Software updates
        and fixes are rolled out seamlessly by the vendors. The API
        provider can focus on creating the API and its back end.</li>
      <li>Increased scalability and agility: The licensing for the cloud
        platforms are generally by API traffic volume. If the traffic
        increases, API providers only pay additional licensing fee for
        the increased traffic. They do not need to bother about capacity
        planning, procurement of hardware, installation, configuration,
        and training needs for the operations personnel. The platform
        vendor makes the required changes to provision the additional
        capacity requested. This makes cloud environments ideal for
        horizontal scaling to meet the increased demand.</li>
      <li>Regulatory compliance: Often regulatory compliance
        requirements come in the way of adoption for cloud-hosted
        solutions. But most of the leading API management vendors
        have achieved industry compliances for their cloud-hosted
        platforms and their products. PCI DSS for the payment industry
        and HIPAA for the health industry are the most common
        industry compliance requirements. Since the platform is already
        compliant to the industry standards, it helps the client to easily
        meet the PCI requirements for security and log management on
        the cloud and other industry compliances.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>On-Premise Deployment</h3>
    <p class="pText">In an on-premise deployment model, the API provider purchases the software and
      takes the responsibility of setting up and running the entire platform in its data centers.
      The API provider takes up all the management overhead of installing, running, and
      maintaining the API platform. They are responsible for the hardware procurement,
      data center setup, and network configuration. The responsibility to monitor the API
      platform performance, deal with outages, update and manage software versions and
      capacity scaling lies with the API provider. Managing the entire API platform also needs
      additional training about the platform. Though there are initial challenges for setting up
      the on-premise infrstructure, following reasons can be the main drivers for on-premise
      deployment.</p>
    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li>Enhanced security: With an on-premise deployment model, the
        API service provider has full control on the data security. They
        can manage where the under lying data stores would be present,
        how infrastructure and the data in it is secured, and who can have
        access to it. This also meets the increased security audit needs of
        the enterprise.</li>
      <li>Reduced network latency: Since the API gateway is installed
        within the enterprise’s network, it cuts down on multiple network
        hops. API providers may also plan to install the API gateways
        within the same network as the back-end services. This reduces the
        network latency and increases the overall performance of the APIs.</li>
      <li>Better management and control: On-premise versioning
        provides better management and control over performance and
        scaling. You can decide on the number of instances of the product
        components to be installed to support increased load. You have
        control over changes to the environment configuration, such as
        software and hardware upgrades.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>APIs for Internal Application Integration</h3>
    <p class="pText">Enterprises use SOA for building services to achieve loose coupling and reusability.
      These services are used for internal application integration. SOAP and other protocols
      are used for integration. SOA provided the right level of security and governance, but
      faced with the challenge of making the services easily discoverable and consumable.With huge investments already
      placed in SOA services, and with many business
      processes built around them, companies are less likely to throw it all out to embrace
      REST APIs. Hence, building an API on a clean slate is a rare opportunity. APIs have to be
      built on top of the SOA services that expose the back-end services to make them more
      consumer-friendly.</p>

    <h3>APIs for Business Partner Integration</h3>

    <p class="pText">Enterprise have been consuming third-party APIs to simplify and expand business
      partnership. When APIs are used for B2B partner integration, they grow the business
      rapidly. APIs provide faster integration and an improved partner/customer experience.
      The technicalities of creating APIs for partner integration are not much different.
      However, they are more rigorous and have a commercial aspect tied to it. Instead of being
      open to all, they are available to a select list of business partners. The API consumers
      and providers are bound by the legal business contracts for the use of the APIs. These
      business contracts govern the service levels and other aspects of API delivery and
      consumption. Both API consumers and API providers are responsible for the success of
      an API program.</p>
    <h3>APIs for External Digital Consumers</h3>
    <p class="pText">APIs have been adopted by enterprises to accelerate digital transformation, increase
      customer reach and loyalty, and discover new streams of revenue. Companies can now
      expose their business assets and service to a larger community of developers with an easy
      to use and intuitive API interface.APIs exposed to external digital consumers need a platform that is interactive
      and provides proactive support to developer community. An API portal provides
      such a platform. It publishes information about the APIs that developers can use for
      building apps. Interactive API documentation, blogs, and forums help the developer
      determine the suitability of an API. It also fosters collaboration with a bigger community
      of developers.Externalization of APIs and collaboration with other developers build an ecosystem
      of innovation. It helps developers to share ideas and read about the experiences of others.
      It generates new and innovative ideas that otherwise would not have been possible. Many
      companies have seen a northbound trend in their API traffic due to the new experiences
      brought in by apps created by external developers using their APIs.</p>


    <h3>APIs for Mobile</h3>
    <p class="pText">Mobile apps have changed the way that humans interact with enterprises. Even though
      computing power is shifting from server rooms to mobile devices, mobile apps are
      still limited in resources and restricted by bandwidth. Hence, building a mobile app
      mandated a simpler interface that can be consumed easily. Also the interface should be
      such that it can be easily shared with developers to consume them in the apps. RESTful
      APIs have all of these characteristics, which make them popular for mobile consumption.
      The API provider should take into considerations the design, security and operational
      aspects of the API to make them suitable for mobile consumption. Additionally, caching
      should be looked as an alternative for improving performance and reducing chattiness.
      Instead of sending bulk payloads, paginations, filtering and other mechanisms should be
      supported to reduce processing overhead on the mobile app. Standard web API security
      protocols such as OAuth and OpenID Connect should be supported to secure APIs and
      make them suitable for mobile consumption.</p>


    <h3>APIs for IoT</h3>

    <p class="pText">
      The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of devices, sensors, and actuators that
      communicate with each other over the Internet using API technologies to build a new
      customer experience. This refers to wearable devices such as iWatch, connected cars,
      connected sensors—such as Nest thermostats, intelligent bulbs—such as Philips Hue,
      and many others. It is estimated that by 2020 there will be 50 billion connected devices.
      APIs form the communication foundation for these connected devices. But the challenge
      is with the diverse and the newer communication protocols, such as MQTT, AMQT,
      XMPP, and many others that need to be supported by the API platform. A new generation
      of infrastructure powered by autoscalling capabilities, may also be needed in furture to
      support the scale of IoT communication traffic.</p>
