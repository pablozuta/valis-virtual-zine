    <h2>CHAPTER 1 Introduction to APIs</h2>

    
    <p class="pText">
      API stands for application programming interface. An API helps expose a business
      service or an enterprise asset to the developers building an application.
      An API is a software-to-software interface that defines the contract for applications to talk to each other over a
      network without user interaction.
      The contract defines the protocol, the input and output formats, and the underlying
      data types to be used for the software components to interact. It defines the functionality that is independent of the
      underlying implementation technologies of the component.</p>

    <h3>The Evolution of APIs</h3>
    
    
    
    <p class="pText">
      The term API may mean different things to different people, depending on the context.
      There are APIs for operating systems, applications, and the Web. For example, Windows
      provides APIs that are used by system hardware and applications. When you copy text
      or a picture from Microsoft PowerPoint to Word, the APIs are at work.
    
      By the year 2006, web APIs are demonstrating the power of the Internet. They are
      being used to share content and made available to social networks. But they are still not
      considered fit for mainstream businesses. This year also marks the beginning of the cloud
      computing era.
    
      With cloud computing, web APIs witness their real power. APIs can now be
      used to deploy global infrastructure.
    
      By 2012—after the introduction of powerful smartphones, iPads, tablets, and the
      growth of Android and Windows Mobile, the need for APIs to provide resources to build
      apps has grown exponentially.
    <h3>APIs Are Different from Web Sites</h3>
    <p class="pText">Web sites publish information that can be consumed by a user, but web sites do not have
      contracts. The layout, content, and the look and feel of a web site can change without prior notice to users.
      An API, on the other hand, has a well-defined contract. Other applications depend
      on this contract to use it.</p>
    <h3>Defining an API and Its Characteristics</h3>
    <p class="pText">In technical terms, an API defines the contract of a software component in terms of the
      protocol, data format, and the endpoint for two computer applications to communicate
      with each other over a network.</p>
    <h3>Types of APIs</h3>
    <p class="pText">Broadly classifying, APIs can be divided into two types: public APIs and private APIs
      Since public
      APIs expose the back-end systems of an organization through the enterprise firewall that
      can be accessed by all, they are open doors for hackers to intrude into the system.
    
      Private APIs are behind the closed doors of your organization.
      How do you make an API private? One simple way is to host it on a public network
      but not publicize its existence and documentation to the developer community.</p>
    <h3>Examples of Popular APIs</h3>
    <p class="pText">The history of web APIs dates back to 2005. Since then, the growth in the number of APIs
      is exponential. ProgrammableWeb maintains a repository of public APIs and has more than 13,000 APIs under different
      categories.Facebook APIs provide a platform for building applications
      that can be used by a member of the Facebook community.
      Google APIs allow communication with Google services, such
      as Search, Translate, Gmail, Maps, social, and advertising.
      AccuWeather APIs provide subscribers with access to locationbased
      weather data via a simple RESTful web interface.
      Twitter provides three types of APIs: REST APIs, search APIs, and
      streaming APIs.</p>
    <h3>The Difference Between a Web Service and a Web API</h3>
    <p class="pText">Wikipedia defines a web service as “a method of communication between two electronic
      devices over a network”.
      Going by these definitions, a web API can be considered as a subset of a web service.
      SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) web services typically use HTTP as a transport protocol, although this is not
      mandatory. SOAP can be over JMS/FTP/SMTP or any layer 7 protocol.
      A web API is a special kind of web service, where the emphasis has been moving
      to a simpler RErepresentational State transfer (REST)
      So far web services have been synonymous to SOAP web services. With the advent
      of REST, web APIs have been commonly referred to as RESTful web services.
      In terms of performance, SOAP-based web services are heavyweight, requiring
      additional processing of extra SOAP elements in the payload. REST-based web services
      are simpler with lightweight</p>
    <h3>How Are APIs Different from SOA?</h3>
    <p class="pText">Many often ask what the difference between APIs and SOA is.
      SOA stands for service-oriented architecture. Its core concept is the notion of service.
      A service can be defined as “a logical representation of a repeatable activity that has a
      specific outcome.”
      From a technical perspective, APIs also share the same characteristics. But they
      are more open, developer centric, easily consumable, and support human-readable
      formats, such as JSON.
      Services are the means by which providers codify the base capabilities of their
      domains. APIs are the way in which those capabilities are repackaged, productized, and
      shared in an easy-to-use format.
      At a technology level, SOA is related to XML and SOAP, whereas APIs are related to
      REST and JSON.
      Keeping the technical differences aside, the real difference between SOA and APIs
      center on scope and governance.
      API technology focuses on the consumption of the back-end services created using
      SOA principles. Hence, APIs can be thought of as an evolution of SOA
      From a governance perspective, SOA is managed through a governance model that
      is more formal, heavyweight, and prescriptive in nature.
    
      ---The API Value Chain
      The business asset marks the beginning of the API value chain.
      The value of the asset determines the success of the API. Exposing the assets to
      others should also benefit the owner.
      Once an asset has been identified, the next step is to create an API to expose the
      business assets.
      The app developers then assess the APIs and create apps using them.
      The apps created by the developers can be mobile apps or web apps.
      The end users are the final actor in the API value chain.</p>
    <h3>Business Models for APIs</h3>
    <p class="pText">APIs form the foundation of digital business.
      As APIs help to drive business agility, growth and open new channels for revenue,
      there are many business models for API exposure.</p>

    <h2>PENSAMIENTOS SOBRE ZINE FAIRS</h2>


    <img class="imagen-articulo" src="images/c-64.png" alt="imagen de computador commodore c-64">

    <p class="pText">In the late 1990s, biologist Andrew Hendry noticed similarly quick changes in phenotype while
      studying salmon. (Phenotype refers to the trait that actually exists in the animal, even if it’s not reflected by
      a change in its underlying genetic code.) “We had this impression that well, actually, maybe this rapid evolution
      thing is not so exceptional,” says Hendry, now a professor at McGill University in Montreal. “Maybe it’s actually
      occurring all the time, and people just haven’t emphasized it.”</p>

    <p class="pText">With a colleague, Michael Kinnison (now at the University of Maine), Hendry pulled together a
      database of examples of rapid evolution and wrote a 1999 paper that kickstarted interest in the field. Now, Hendry
      and colleagues have updated and expanded the original data set with more than 5,000 additional examples:
      everything from the cranial depth of the common chaffinch to the lifespan of the Trinidadian guppy. Scientists are
      using this data to answer questions about how fast and far the natural world is changing, and how much of the
      change is due to humans.</p>
    <p class="pText">In an initial paper published in November 2021 using the new data set (which is called Proceed, for
      Phenotypic Rates of Change Evolutionary and Ecological Database), Hendry and colleagues reexamined five key
      questions raised by previous work. They confirmed, for instance, that on average, all over the world, animal
      species seem to be getting smaller. This runs contrary to a theory of evolution called Cope’s rule, which posits
      that species should increase in size over time. “It’s better to be larger,” says Kiyoko Gotanda, a coauthor on the
      paper who is now at Brock University in Ontario. “You’ll get more mates, you have a better survival rate.” But
      when they analyzed the new data, the results confirmed a finding from a previous paper by Gotanda. “There seems to
      be an overall decline in body size due to things like climate change, and other types of human influences,” she
      says.</p>
    <p class="pText">Hunting and harvesting are the biggest drivers of this trend: If humans pluck the fattest fish from
      the ocean each time they cast their nets, it follows that only the smaller ones will survive to pass on their
      genes. But climate could also play a role because of a basic rule of biology: Larger creatures have a bigger
      surface area to volume ratio, and therefore find it easier to retain heat. “The theory is that you don’t need to
      maintain that larger body size as the temperatures are warming, and so you can be smaller,” Gotanda says.</p>

    <img class="imagen-articulo" src="images/dune.jpg" alt="imagen de dune">

    <p class="pText">This might seem like a minor concern, in the wake of coral bleaching and mass extinction, but it
      could have serious knock-on effects. Take salmon for instance: Smaller fish mean less money for the communities
      who rely on catching them. It means less food for the wolves and bears that feed on them. It means they produce
      proportionally fewer eggs, which play an important role in adding nutrients to the rivers when salmon return there
      to spawn. “Reduction in salmon body size is directly affecting nature’s contributions to people, and that results
      in less protein, less eggs, less salmon returning, and has huge effects on the ecosystem at multiple levels,” says
      Sarah Sanderson, the paper’s lead author and a biology PhD candidate at McGill.</p>
    <p class="pText">Trait changes can have similar effects. A 2021 study in Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park found
      that the proportion of female elephants being born without tusks has shot up to more than 50 percent, as extreme
      levels of poaching during a 15-year civil war turned survival of the fittest on its head. Elephants without tusks
      were far more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation. Tuskless elephants won’t shape ecosystems in
      the same way as their toothier brethren: They won’t tear up the soil as much when digging for tubers, for
      instance. And analyzing DNA in their feces revealed that tuskless elephants eat different plants.</p>

    <p class="pText">
      I have poor command-line hygiene. When I fever-dream a useful pipeline into existence, I very seldom commit it to
      a shell configuration somewhere. Rather, I let fzf dredge it up sometime later when I need it. My functions are
      not documented, have hideously short names and variables because I tend to code golf, and are specific to the
      use-case-at-the-time and not general.



      I’ve since decided that this is the optimal approach.

      Take That Statement Back, You Deviant
      No! I actually believe this. I have reasons.



      The notion of a command or shell history in our profession is a profoundly under-appreciated mechanism.
