    <h2>ENTREVISTA OWLNIGHT RECORDINGS</h2>

    <p class="pText">CHARLES DARWIN THOUGHT of evolution as an incremental process, like the patient creep of glaciers
      or the march of continental plates. “We see nothing of these slow changes in progress until the hand of time has
      marked the long lapse of ages,” he wrote in On the Origin of Species, his famous 1859 treatise on natural
      selection.

      But by the 1970s, scientists were finding evidence that Darwin might be wrong—at least about the timescale.
      Peppered moths living in industrial areas of Britain were getting darker, better for blending in against the
      soot-blackened buildings and avoiding predation from the air. House sparrows—introduced to North America from
      Europe—were changing size and color according to the climate of their new homes. Tufted hairgrass growing around
      electricity pylons was developing a tolerance for zinc (which is used as a coating for pylons, and can be toxic to
      plants).</p>



    <p class="pText">In the late 1990s, biologist Andrew Hendry noticed similarly quick changes in phenotype while
      studying salmon. (Phenotype refers to the trait that actually exists in the animal, even if it’s not reflected by
      a change in its underlying genetic code.) “We had this impression that well, actually, maybe this rapid evolution
      thing is not so exceptional,” says Hendry, now a professor at McGill University in Montreal. “Maybe it’s actually
      occurring all the time, and people just haven’t emphasized it.”</p>

    <p class="pText">With a colleague, Michael Kinnison (now at the University of Maine), Hendry pulled together a
      database of examples of rapid evolution and wrote a 1999 paper that kickstarted interest in the field. Now, Hendry
      and colleagues have updated and expanded the original data set with more than 5,000 additional examples:
      everything from the cranial depth of the common chaffinch to the lifespan of the Trinidadian guppy. Scientists are
      using this data to answer questions about how fast and far the natural world is changing, and how much of the
      change is due to humans.</p>
    <p class="pText">In an initial paper published in November 2021 using the new data set (which is called Proceed, for
      Phenotypic Rates of Change Evolutionary and Ecological Database), Hendry and colleagues reexamined five key
      questions raised by previous work. They confirmed, for instance, that on average, all over the world, animal
      species seem to be getting smaller. This runs contrary to a theory of evolution called Cope’s rule, which posits
      that species should increase in size over time. “It’s better to be larger,” says Kiyoko Gotanda, a coauthor on the
      paper who is now at Brock University in Ontario. “You’ll get more mates, you have a better survival rate.” But
      when they analyzed the new data, the results confirmed a finding from a previous paper by Gotanda. “There seems to
      be an overall decline in body size due to things like climate change, and other types of human influences,” she
      says.</p>
    <p class="pText">Hunting and harvesting are the biggest drivers of this trend: If humans pluck the fattest fish from
      the ocean each time they cast their nets, it follows that only the smaller ones will survive to pass on their
      genes. But climate could also play a role because of a basic rule of biology: Larger creatures have a bigger
      surface area to volume ratio, and therefore find it easier to retain heat. “The theory is that you don’t need to
      maintain that larger body size as the temperatures are warming, and so you can be smaller,” Gotanda says.</p>
    <img class="imagen-articulo" src="images/metaverse.jpg" alt="imagen del metaverso">
    <p class="pText">This might seem like a minor concern, in the wake of coral bleaching and mass extinction, but it
      could have serious knock-on effects. Take salmon for instance: Smaller fish mean less money for the communities
      who rely on catching them. It means less food for the wolves and bears that feed on them. It means they produce
      proportionally fewer eggs, which play an important role in adding nutrients to the rivers when salmon return there
      to spawn. “Reduction in salmon body size is directly affecting nature’s contributions to people, and that results
      in less protein, less eggs, less salmon returning, and has huge effects on the ecosystem at multiple levels,” says
      Sarah Sanderson, the paper’s lead author and a biology PhD candidate at McGill.</p>
    <p class="pText">Trait changes can have similar effects. A 2021 study in Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park found
      that the proportion of female elephants being born without tusks has shot up to more than 50 percent, as extreme
      levels of poaching during a 15-year civil war turned survival of the fittest on its head. Elephants without tusks
      were far more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation. Tuskless elephants won’t shape ecosystems in
      the same way as their toothier brethren: They won’t tear up the soil as much when digging for tubers, for
      instance. And analyzing DNA in their feces revealed that tuskless elephants eat different plants.</p>

      I have poor command-line hygiene. When I fever-dream a useful pipeline into existence, I very seldom commit it to
      a shell configuration somewhere. Rather, I let fzf dredge it up sometime later when I need it. My functions are
      not documented, have hideously short names and variables because I tend to code golf, and are specific to the
      use-case-at-the-time and not general.



      I’ve since decided that this is the optimal approach.

      Take That Statement Back, You Deviant
      No! I actually believe this. I have reasons.



      The notion of a command or shell history in our profession is a profoundly under-appreciated mechanism.

      Here’s an actual example taken from my own work. Your use case may be different, but one situation that I run into
