      <h4>VIRTUAL LIGHT</h4>

      <p class="parrafo2">Virtual Light is a science fiction novel by American-Canadian writer William Gibson, the first
        book in his Bridge trilogy. Virtual Light is a science-fiction novel set in a postmodern, dystopian, cyberpunk

        produces optical sensations directly in the eye without the use of photons.[1] The novel was a finalist nominee
        for a Hugo Award, and shortlisted for the Locus Award in 1994.</p>

      <h4>VALIS</h4>

      <p>VALIS is a story of a man, named Philip (same as the author), and his journey to find God with his alter-ego,
        Horselover Fat. Most of the story is a narrative that disguises a set of theological ideals established by Dick.
        The major subject of this narrative is spirituality, as both the protagonist, his alter-ego, and the author (who
        are all essentially one and the same) are ostensibly obsessed with several religions and philosophies, including
        Christianity, Taoism, Gnosticism, and even Jungian psychoanalysis. They are searching for a cure for what he
        believes is simultaneously both a personal and a cosmic wound.</p>

      <h4>DUNE</h4>

      <p class="parrafo2">Dune is based on a complex imagined society set roughly 20,000 years in the future. The
        setting is the year 10,191, and human beings have spread out and colonized planets throughout the universe. On
        the planet Caladan, Duke Leto of the House of Atreides is preparing to leave for his new position as the
        governor of Arrakis, a desert planet with valuable resources of melange, a spice drug that is extremely popular
        with wealthy people. Leto and his family, including his concubine, Jessica, and his son, Paul, suspect a trap by
        their rivals, the Harkonnens, led by Baron Harkonnen. Leto decides to settle on Arrakis because of its rich
        supplies of melange, despite warnings from his men, including his adviser, Thufir Hawat, and his master-of-arms,
        Gurney Halleck.</p>

      <p class="parrafo2">Magnetic bolts thudded out of position around the massive
        imitation-rosewood door to the left of the bookcases. JULIUS DEANE
        IMPORT EXPORT was lettered across the plastic in peeling selfadhesive
        capitals. If the furniture scattered in Deane’s makeshift foyer
        suggested the end of the past century, the office itself seemed to belong
        to its start.</p>

      <h4>TOKIO SUSHIBAR </h4>

      <p class="parrafo2">Rain woke him, a slow drizzle, his feet tangled
        in coils of discarded fiberoptics. The arcade’s sea of sound washed over
        him, receded, returned. Rolling over, he sat up and held his head.
        Light from a service hatch at the rear of the arcade showed him
        broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a gutted
        game console. Streamlined Japanese was stenciled across the side of the
        console in faded pinks and yellows.</p>

      <h4>COUNT</h4>

      <p>The sailor in the white t-shirt was gone. The arcade was empty,
        silent. Case turned slowly, his shoulders hunched, teeth bared, his hands
        bunched into involuntary fists. Empty. A crumpled yellow candy wrapper,
        balanced on the edge of a console, dropped to the floor and lay
        amid flattened butts and styrofoam cups. </p>

      <h4>NIGHT STREETS</h4>

      <p class="parrafo2">Yes. And I assembled the file you accessed in London. I try to
        plan, in your sense of the word, but that isn’t my basic mode, really.
        I improvise. It’s my greatest talent. I prefer situations to plans, you
        see. . . . Really, I’ve had to deal with givens. I can sort a great deal of
        information, and sort it very quickly. It’s taken a very long time to
        assemble the team you’re a part of. Corto was the first, and he very
        nearly didn’t make it. Very far gone, in Toulon. Eating, excreting, and
        masturbating were the best he could manage. But the underlying structure
        of obsessions was there: Screaming Fist, his betrayal, the Congressional
        hearings.</p>
