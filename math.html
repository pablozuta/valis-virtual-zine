        <h2>5000 YEARS OF GEOMETRY</h2>
        <p class="pText">It is certainly not easy to define the content and nature of mathematics. <br>
            Long before writing was developed, mankind may have realised and systematically
            used geometrical structures.     <br>
            The frequent calculation of the diagonals of rectangles by means of the
Pythagorean Theorem is particularly striking, given that it was centuries before
Pythagoras was even born. <br>

        <p class="pText">
            I have poor command-line hygiene. When I fever-dream a useful pipeline into existence, I very seldom commit
            it to
            a shell configuration somewhere. Rather, I let fzf dredge it up sometime later when I need it. My functions
            are
            not documented, have hideously short names and variables because I tend to code golf, and are specific to
            the
            use-case-at-the-time and not general.



            I’ve since decided that this is the optimal approach.

            Take That Statement Back, You Deviant
            No! I actually believe this. I have reasons.



            The notion of a command or shell history in our profession is a profoundly under-appreciated mechanism.



            Consider the fact that – if you retain all history and express all of your operational tasks in the form of
            terminal commands – you may have the entire history of your work (apart from coding artifacts) within a few
            seconds’ reach. How do you create x509 certs with openssl? What’s the easiest way to check for Spectre among
            a
            fleet of hosts? If you can recall a few substrings from the commands that may answer the question, a history
            search can bring this lost memory to your fingertips to be re-used immediately.



            Imagine how another profession may value this type of instant, infinitely-retained, zero-effort-to-record
            recall
            that translates into an immediately-usable action. A lawyer submitting a particular type of legal document?

            history
            at the intersection of white-collar software engineering work holds tremendous potential.



            Here’s an actual example taken from my own work. Your use case may be different, but one situation that I
            run into
            sometimes is unsealing a Vault instance for a host that I’ve brought down for something like a kernel
            update. The
            feedback loop looks kind of like this:</p>

            waste.The semiotics of the bright void beyond the chain link. Sexless and inhumanly patient, his primary
